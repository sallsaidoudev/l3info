           MLGame - OCaml Game System - release 0.11x

NOTE! MLGame is in developement, and the interface is subject to change.


WHAT IS MLGame?

  MLGame is a 2d game library for OCaml built on top of SDL (OCamlSDL).
  It is fully working, and stable (but for the interface)
  It features:

   * Sprites
   * Collision         (per pixel or per rect)
   * Video contexts    (parts of screen may display parts of world)
   * Network           (high level protocol with callbacks)
   * Console           (parser with variables, aliases, scripts, ...)
   * Menu
   * Input handling    (bindings, input modes)
   * Widgets
   * Video Primitives

INSTALLING MLGame:

  Basically do: `./configure; make`
  
  MLGame should work for any platform for which OCamlSDL works.
  It has been tested under Linux, Windows, OpenBSD, BeOS and Solaris.

  For more information about specific platform requirements see Docs/INSTALL

DOCUMENTATION:

  General gaming usage can be found in: Docs/Console

  Developement documentation can be created using ocamldoc with `make doc`.
  It will be generated in MLG/doc/ directory.

  Simple examples are in Examples subdirectory.
