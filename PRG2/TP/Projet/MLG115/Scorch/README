Keys: 

General:
 ~       - toggle console
 esc     - toggle menu
 
In game:
 cursors        - aim
 ctrl + cursors - aim with bigger step
 enter          - fire
 tab            - change weapons
 
doc/command - some info on commands

The shop is incomplete, so to buy some weapons, open console, and type
buy <quantity> <weapon id>
To get list of available weapons and their ids, type shop (in console). 
The id is the two or three letter intelligible word. 

If you have problem, and you think its rather scorch than MLGame related, 
do not hesitate to contact me. Just any feedback is welcome.
