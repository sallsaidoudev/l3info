Q: In the game I develop I sometimes get segmentation faults. What can cause
   them?

 A: Most probably you called a MLGame function with your function (calling it
    again) given as a callback. Infinite recursion (with calling c code)
    causes segfaults.

Q: I get [Fatal] Net.sth errors. What can cause them?

 A: Most probably two instances of the program have got other protocol
    versions. Either you call one of Net.add_sth only on one, or you are
    trying to communicate with older version of your program / another MLGame
    program.

Q: Can I use the .data component of a sprite?

 A: Yes, It is for you!

Q: How to check all collisions?

 A: For all your sprite sets do: 
    Sprite.Set.iter Sprite.check_collisions set

Q: Can I compare sprites?

 A: Every sprite structure includes a numerical id that is there so that 
    two sprites with the same parameters and data can be different.

Q: How to make tiles?

 A: Add a buch of sprites with the same image to a sprite set, and draw the
    set.

Q: Is it possible to change the image that the sprite is displaing?

 A: Yes!, See Sprite.set_animation_frame and Sprite.set_frames.
