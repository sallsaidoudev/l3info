Get the complete cygwin-with-sdl-ocaml-etc-pack.tgz

Or try something like this:
(Last tried on 10 May 2005, with lastest versions from that date)

 
1) Get cygwin with
   - gcc (the automatically selected mingw version)
   - ocaml
   - libjpeg
   - libtiff
   - libungif
   - make
2) Download libSDL
   - ./configure -prefix=/usr
   - make (should compile things with "-mno-cygwin"
   - Go to src/main subdirectory
   - edit Makefile, remove -mno-cygwin
   - edit w32/SDL*c, remove #include direct.h
   - make (in this subdirecroty)
   - return to main SDL directory
   - make install
3) Download libSDL_image
   - ./configure -prefix=/usr
   - make
   - make install
   - remove /usr/lib/libSDL_image.dll.a
   - edit /usr/lib/libSDL_image.la
     - change the entry about '.dll.a' file to just '.a'
4) Download ocaml_sdl
   - ./configure
   - make
   - make install
5) Download MLG
   - ./configure
   - make
   cd Scorch
   ./Scorch.exe

Possible problems:
  Do not use directories which include spaces in compilation,
  eg compilation in "/home/John Doe" wont work.

Good luck.
