Client - instance of the program with no server, connected to a server.
Packet - size of information + actual information

If we are the server, and where are the players is not the game-writers concern.

He knows:
  - The local players (to manage split screen or sth)
  - How many players are there at all.

Every 'connect' creates a new player. All instances get cli_change_fun.

When we became a client we receive all world serializers and start to receive frames.
