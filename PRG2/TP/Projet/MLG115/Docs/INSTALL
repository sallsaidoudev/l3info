PREREQUISITES:
 - OCaml                                       (ocaml* in $PATH)
 - SDL & SDL_image                            (in $LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
 - SDL headers                                (sdl-config in $PATH)
 - OCamlSDL                                    (in $OCAMLLIB/sdl)

COMPILATION INSTRUCTION:
 - Linux, Beos:                    ./configure; make
 - Solaris, *BSD:                  ./configure; gmake
 - Windows/Cygwin:                 see INSTALL-cygwin
 - Windows/MSVC++ (HARD!)
   (not tested since 2003):        cp Config/MSVC/OMakefile .; make

OPTIONS:
 - Instead of SDL you can use OpenGL, it requires compiling OCamlSDL with
   SDL-gl headers and is hard, but gives usually better hw acceleration
